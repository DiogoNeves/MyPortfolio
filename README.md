# Development

At the moment there isn't much, I'm just trying to get something up and running quickly and won't be very flexible!  
You can expect it to be sligthly more flexible and costumisable in the near future though (open to any help or suggestions :) )  
  
## Notes

* Most things are hardcoded (e.g. icon). Will change! Please create an issue if you want something to be made costumisable  
* I've selected ICS 4.0.3 as min API level, this is just to simplify the initial development. I will lower the min later
